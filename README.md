# Svelte Component Library

This is a lab-project for mess around with components created with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). This is subject to change,
 not ment for production code or environment and has so no support from my side for such things.
It is more ment to be an example (one of many) how to do things in [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/).
This project is based on a very plain [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), in combination with [Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) and [SCSS/SASS](https://sass-lang.com/).

## Requirements
- You'll need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed

## Installation

```bash
npm i
```

## Start development

```bash

After the task has started you can open your browser at [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

## Build

```bash
npm run build

After the task was executed (without errors) you'll find your code in 'public/build'. Note that deleting 'public' will break the code, so don't do this.
